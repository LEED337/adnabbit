- **Service Layer**: Separated business logic into dedicated service classes
- **Mock Data**: Implemented realistic mock data for demonstration purposes
- **Future-Ready**: Structured for easy integration with real APIs

### Data Models
- `BankAccount` - Represents connected bank accounts
- `BankInfo` - Bank information and branding
- `ProductInfo` - Product details for price comparison
- `PriceComparison` - Price comparison data across retailers
- `PriceHistory` - Historical price data
- `DealRecommendation` - Deal and discount information
- `SpendingInsights` - Analytics and spending patterns

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements

### Design Consistency
- Maintained consistent color scheme and branding
- Used gradient backgrounds and modern card designs
- Implemented proper loading states and error handling
- Added appropriate icons and visual feedback

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation between features
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Informative placeholder content
- Responsive design elements

## ðŸš€ Future Development Ready

### API Integration Points
- Bank connection service ready for real banking APIs (Plaid, Yodlee)
- Price comparison service structured for retail API integration
- Modular design allows easy swapping of mock services with real implementations

### Security Considerations
- Placeholder for credential encryption
- Structured for secure API key management
- Ready for OAuth implementation

### Scalability
- Service-oriented architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Easy to extend with additional banks and retailers

## ðŸ“± Current App Status

### Build Status
- âœ… App compiles successfully
- âœ… Web build working
- âœ… All routes functional
- âœ… Navigation working properly

### Known Limitations
- Bank integration uses mock data (by design for Phase 2)
- Price comparison shows placeholder content
- Some advanced features marked as "Coming Soon"

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Phase 3

### Recommended Priorities
1. **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual banking and retail APIs
2. **Enhanced Security**: Implement proper credential encryption and OAuth
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Build comprehensive spending insights dashboard
4. **Push Notifications**: Add price alerts and savings milestone notifications
5. **User Onboarding**: Create guided setup for bank connections

### Technical Debt
- Replace mock services with real API implementations
- Add comprehensive error handling for network requests
- Implement proper loading states for async operations
- Add unit and integration tests

## ðŸ“Š Metrics and Success Criteria
