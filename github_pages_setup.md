# Setting Up GitHub Pages Correctly

## Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/LEED337/muststash
2. Click on "Settings"
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"

## Step 2: Verify Source Settings
1. Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", make sure "Deploy from a branch" is selected
2. Under "Branch", select "gh-pages" from the dropdown
3. Make sure the folder is set to "/ (root)"
4. Click "Save" if you made any changes

## Step 3: Check Deployment Status
1. After saving, GitHub will show a message like "Your site is being built"
2. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete
3. Once done, you'll see a message with your site's URL: "Your site is live at https://leed337.github.io/muststash/"

## Step 4: Check Custom Domain (if applicable)
1. If you're not using a custom domain, skip this step
2. If you want to use a custom domain, enter it in the "Custom domain" field
3. Click "Save"
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions provided by GitHub

## Step 5: Check Deployment History
1. In the Pages settings, look for "Deployments" section
2. Click on "View deployment history" to see all recent deployments
3. Check if there are any failed deployments and their error messages

## Step 6: Enforce HTTPS
1. Make sure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked for secure access to your site

## Step 7: Check for Build Errors
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Look for the most recent workflow run
3. Click on it to see detailed logs
4. Check for any errors in the build or deployment process

If your site still isn't working after verifying these settings, there might be an issue with the build process or the content of your gh-pages branch.
